# Fine Grained Sentiment Analysis for Yelp Restaurant Review 

## Overview

Using aspect level sentiment analysis to help restaurant owner perform decision making 

## Issue

As restaurant owner, the reviews given is valuable insight for their business. However, the Yelp review data is not annotated with quality dimension such as taste, services, etc. Given limited resources the owner have, he or she would need detailed insight to optimize resource allocation to improve his or her restaurant performance 

## Solution

Using target dependent sentiment analysis, we aim to extract five main entities, that is, cleanliness, food taste, service, location, and price, from the yelp review data and analyze the sentiment for each aspect. See more in https://youtu.be/APIFXWAkth8
